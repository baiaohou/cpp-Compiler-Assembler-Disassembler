# C++ Compiler, Assembler and Disassembler Design

## Author: Leo Baiao Hou ***(Implemented in C)***

Implemented a simple compiler that converts C++ code to LC-4 assembly code. Developed an assembler that reads asm files and generates their machine / binary equivalent (obj files). Also developed a disassembler for the reverse operation.
