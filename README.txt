Hi TAs!

I've been struggling for a long time finding memory leak. But after I made many attempts freeing my malloced variables, I found that my program would segfault. Thus, to run successfully, I commented most of my *free* calls in my code to make my code compile and run.

I'm sorry about that, and please give me some suggestions in finding memory leak and avoiding making errors! Thank you!
